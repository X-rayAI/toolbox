## A few blog posts that give a nice flavor of how machine learning is really becoming like super powers now.

The first by a guy from Stanford & Google and now chief of AI at Tesla, Andrej Karpathy:

This one is from Greg Brockman, who Elon Musk and Sam Altman recruited to be a co-founder and CTO of OpenAI. It is a nice perspective as a newcomer diving into AI:

## These authoritatively cover everything you need to know for the basics:

This is an online book by a really smart guy at YC Research, Michael Nielsen:

This is a widely popular online video course by Andrew Ng, ex Stanford, Google, and Baidu:

This is the authoritative book on the basics of deep learning -- even Elon Musk said so  :)  though some newcomers see it as challenging.  It's three parts, and really just part 2 gives you all the basics of deep learning.  Part 1 is just review of the underlying math if you need a review, and part 3 introduces areas of new research -- but the material in part 2 gives you enough to understand and apply deep learning engineering:

Andreessen Horowitz has a very informative AI Playbook:
